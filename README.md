# Live Pet Extension Bot  [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hitsounds/twitch.tv-live-pet-bot/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hitsounds/twitch.tv-live-pet-bot)

A little script I made to interact with the live pet extension on twitch.tv streams.

Requires python (i used 3.7 others may work though).
Other dependancies can be installed via the .bat file.

To get the channel id and authentication code you will have to look in your netowrk traffic while clicking on the pet(hint: search for "pet" and look at request headers). I have only confirmed that it works for me so problems may arise if others use. So please open an issue if you have problems.

BTW I have little experiance with this and just made it to humour myself.


Testing with twitch api to see if i can improve the program
